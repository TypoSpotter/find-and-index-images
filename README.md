# find-and-index-images
Find all images, and create a .csv with filename, path, date, filesize etc.

I want to find all images on a number of hard drives left by my late father.
I want the images to be indexed: recording the filename, the path, the file size, any available dates (file modified date, date picture taken if available)
I want to be able to mark duplicate files: perhaps if files have matching md5sums and matching file sizes then they are possible duplicate files

The Linux "find" command can find images by name, and then further operations can extract information
